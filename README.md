## 1. Situation
Analyzed **119,390 hotel booking records** from 2015-2017 to evaluate guest demographics, revenue trends, and cancellation risks across City and Resort hotels.
## 2. Task
The objective was to identify high-value customer segments, **calculate Average Daily Rate (ADR)**, and determine the primary drivers of cancellations to minimize revenue loss.
## 3. Action
Utilized **Power BI** to design a comprehensive dashboard, performing data transformation to track critical operational KPIs.
* **Key Metrics:** Calculated a Mean ADR of **$101.83** and an Average Stay duration of **3 nights**.
* **Segment Analysis:** Compared booking behaviors between transient guests and agency bookings.
## 4. Results & Insights
* **Volume Driver:** Tour Agents were the largest source of customers, driving **98,000 bookings**.
* **Risk Identification:** However, this segment carried a massive **41% cancellation risk**, significantly higher than direct bookings or corporate clients.
## 5. Recommendation
* **Policy Change:** Implement stricter non-refundable deposit policies specifically for Tour Agent bookings to mitigate revenue leakage.
* **Operational Adjustment:** Adjust overbooking limits to account for the predictable 41% drop-off rate in this specific segment.
